# Hack for Visual Studio Code

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/slackhq/vscode-hack.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/slackhq/vscode-hack)

This extension adds rich Hack language & HHVM support to Visual Studio Code. Visit [http://hacklang.org](http://hacklang.org) to get started with Hack.

It is published in the Visual Studio Marketplace [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pranayagarwal.vscode-hack). To install, search for "Hack" in the VS Code extensions tab or run the following command (⌘+P): ```ext install vscode-hack```.

## Latest releases

## v1.0.0
- **Integration with HHAST Linter** (thanks [@fredemmott](https://github.com/fredemmott)!). The extension now supports Hack linting and autofixing via [HHAST](https://github.com/hhvm/hhast/) (v3.27.2 or later required). Set up linting for your project by following instructions in the HHAST library, then look at workspace-specific linter settings in the Configuration section below.
- Type coverage now uses the language server
- [Fix] Output panel will no longer automatically steal focus on extension errors

See the full list of releases and features added on the [Github releases page](https://github.com/slackhq/vscode-hack/releases) as well as the project [changelog](https://github.com/slackhq/vscode-hack/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Requirements

This extension is supported on Linux and Mac OS X 10.10 onwards ([see HHVM compatibility](https://docs.hhvm.com/hhvm/installation/introduction)). The latest versions of Hack typechecking tools (`hh_client` and `hh_server`) are required on the local machine. The workspace should have a `.hhconfig` file at its root.    

## Configuration

This extension adds the following Visual Studio Code settings. These can be set in user preferences (⌘+,) or workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`).

* `hack.clientPath`: Absolute path to the hh_client executable. This can be left empty if hh_client is already in your environment $PATH. A `docker exec` command is supported as well.
* `hack.workspaceRootPath`: Absolute path to the workspace root directory. This will be the VS Code workspace root by default, but can be changed if the project is in a subdirectory or mounted in a Docker container.
* `hack.enableCoverageCheck`: Enable calculation of Hack type coverage percentage for every file and display in status bar (default: `true`).
* `hack.useLanguageServer`: Start hh_client in Language Server mode. Only works for HHVM version 3.23 and above (default: `true`).
* `hack.useHhast`: Enable linting (need [HHAST](https://github.com/hhvm/hhast) library set up and configured in project) (default: `true`).
* `hack.hhastPath`: Use alternate hhast-lint path. Can be abolute or relative to workspace root (default: `vendor/bin/hhast-lint`).
* `hack.hhastArgs`: Optional list of arguments passed to hhast-lint executable.
* `hack.hhastLintMode`: Whether to lint the entire project (`whole-project`) or just the open files (`open-files`).
* `hack.rememberedWorkspaces`: Workspaces where whether or not to run custom Hack executables (e.g. hhast-lint) has been remembered. **Note:** This config can only be defined in VS Code global (user) settings.

### Docker

The extension can be used in a contanerized development environment. Simply configure `clientPath` to be a `docker exec` command and specify a `workspaceRootPath` mapping.

E.g. if your container was started using
```bash
$ docker run -d -t --name my-hhvm -v /home/user/repos/project:/mnt/project hhvm/hhvm:latest
```

Configure
```json
"hack.clientPath": "docker exec -i my-hhvm hh_client",
"hack.workspaceRootPath": "/mnt/project"
```
